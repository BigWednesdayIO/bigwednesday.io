## Why

Meet Laura. Laura owns an artisan coffee shop in Soho and needs to find a great new coffee roaster who will deliver fresh coffee beans to her shop every morning.

Meet Steve. Steve is a coffee roaster who wants to sell his coffee beans to retailers like Laura. Steve has to spend time and money promoting his business so that retailers like Laura can discover him.

Laura has learned that it’s a bit of a hassle switching suppliers: she usually has to complete a credit check form and have it approved by the supplier before she can receive her first order.

Laura’s coffee shop isn’t large but she has eight different suppliers who expect her to call her orders through to them daily - so Laura spends an hour a day hunched over her laptop with her phone glued to her ear placing orders. Sometimes Laura finds herself chasing her suppliers for paper purchase invoices which she must manually enter into her accounting software before paying them.

With Orderable Laura can discover new suppliers really easily and communicate with them directly - so Laura talks to Steve and Steve talks to Laura. Laura likes everything Steve tells her about his company and thinks she should try his coffee in her shop. With Orderable Laura can switch to Steve really easily (no credit check required) and be sure that Steve will receive her first order - even if she happens in this occasion to place it at midnight (she was woken by her six-year-old son James who wanted a glass of water).

With Orderable Laura can do her online ordering quickly and easily, she can fill her shopping cart with Steve’s excellent coffee beans, add her other groceries (she has always ordered her milk from her favourite organic farm and she can’t imagine ordering from anyone else) and add fresh produce from a brilliant stall in her street. After she has added her paper products, her cleaning products and her bread and pastries she remembers that she wanted to order some new Pisa Tazzina coffee cups so she adds them to her order too.

Now Laura finds that instead of having to manage eight separate orders she only has to manage one and with Orderable’s quick order feature she discovers that the time it takes her to order the supplies she needs to operate her business isn’t an hour a day, it’s less than 5 minutes. What’s more, Orderable automatically raises supplier invoices for Laura and works with her favourite online accounting software which means she no longer has to enter supplier purchase orders manually. More time saved. More time to engage with her customers. More time to work through that box set after James has woken her again feeling thirsty.
