## Why

Meet Laura. Laura is opening an artisan coffee shop in Soho and needs to find a coffee roaster who will deliver fresh coffee beans to her shop every morning.

Meet Steve. Steve is a coffee roaster who wants to sell his coffee beans to retailers like Laura.

Steve has to spend time and money promoting his business so that retailers like Laura can discover him.

Laura has to spend time and money finding and comparing suppliers like Steve and more time and money placing orders over the phone with each supplier, chasing paper invoices and arranging payments. Nightmare.

With Orderable retailers like Laura can do all their online ordering quickly, easily and once. She can switch suppliers instantly without the hassle of credit checks and completing forms - which is excellent news for Steve.

Orderable saves you time to help you grow your business.
