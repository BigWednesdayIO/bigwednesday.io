## Why

Meet Laura. Laura owns an artisan coffee shop in Soho and needs to find a great new coffee roaster who will deliver fresh coffee beans to her shop each morning.

Meet Steve. Steve is a coffee roaster who wants to sell his coffee beans to retailers like Laura.

Steve has to spend time and money promoting his business so that retailers like Laura will discover him.

Laura has learned that it can take time to switch suppliers: she usually has to complete a credit check and have it approved by the supplier before she can even receive her first order.

Laura has lots of suppliers who expect her to call her orders through to them daily and Laura finds she is spending an hour a day just raising orders. Sometimes Laura finds herself chasing her suppliers for paper purchase invoices which she has to manually enter into her accounting software before she pays them.

With Orderable Laura can discover new suppliers really easily and communicate with them directly - so Laura talks to Steve and decides to order from him. Laura can switch to Steve really easily too and be sure that Steve will receive her first order - even if she updates her order at midnight.

Now Laura can do her online ordering quickly and easily, she can fill her shopping cart with Steve’s excellent coffee beans, add her other groceries (she has always ordered her milk from the same organic farm and she can’t imagine ordering from anyone else) and add fresh produce from a brilliant stall in her street. After she has added her paper products, her bread and her pastries she remembers that she wanted to order some new Pisa Tazzina coffee cups so she adds them to her order too.

Laura only has to manage one order and with Orderable’s quick order feature she discovers that the time it takes her to order the supplies she needs to operate her business isn’t an hour: it’s less than 5 minutes. What’s more, Orderable automatically raises supplier invoices for Laura and works with her favourite online accounting software too. More time saved. More time for Laura to engage with her customers.
