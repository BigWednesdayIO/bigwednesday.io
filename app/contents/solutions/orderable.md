## Why

Meet Laura. Laura owns an artisan coffee shop in Soho and needs to find a great new coffee roaster who will deliver fresh beans to her shop each morning.

Meet Steve. Steve is a coffee roaster who wants to sell his coffee beans to retailers like Laura.

Steve has to spend time and money promoting his business so that retailers like Laura will discover him.

Laura has learned that it can take time to switch suppliers: she usually has to complete a credit check first and have it approved by the supplier before she can even receive her first order.

Laura has lots of different suppliers who expect her to phone her orders through to them during business hours. This takes an hour or more out of Laura’s day. Sometimes Laura finds herself chasing her suppliers for paper purchase invoices which she has to manually enter into her accounting software before she pays them.

With Orderable Laura can discover new suppliers really easily and communicate with them directly - so Laura talks to Steve and decides to order from him. Steve is delighted. Laura finds that switching suppliers with Orderable is really easy too.

Now Laura can do her online ordering quickly and easily: she can fill her shopping cart with Steve’s excellent coffee beans, with milk delivered direct from her favourite organic farm, and with fresh produce from a brilliant stall in her street. After she has added her paper products, her bread and her pastries she suddenly remembers, at 11.30 pm, that she wanted to order some new Pisa Tazzina coffee cups too, so she just logs on using her mobile phone and adds them to her order for delivery tomorrow.

Laura only has to manage one order and with Orderable she discovers that the time it takes her to order the supplies she needs to operate her business isn’t an hour any more: it’s less than 5 minutes. What’s more, Orderable automatically raises supplier purchase invoices for Laura and works with her favourite online accounting software too. More time saved. More time for Laura to take care of her customers.
