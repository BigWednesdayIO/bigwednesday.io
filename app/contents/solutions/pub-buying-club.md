## Why

### You want to enable quick ordering for your lessees

Your lessees want their ordering experience to be quick and easy. Powered by their personal ordering patterns combined with targeted promotions, product ranking adjustments and other business rules, you can help them place their weekly order in minutes while controlling exactly which products and offers are presented to them - and all  with customer- and outlet-specific product pricing and price adjustments.

### You want to increase sales volumes

You want to create demand by personalising every aspect of the user journey using behavioural data, purchase history and cognitive science: create demand by showing low stock notifications for relevant products; create urgency by creating countdown timers that work towards specific dates or times of the day; provide social endorsement by showing user activity or by surfacing relevant reviews and target customers with promotions unique to them.

### Your lessees want to re-order from their cellar

Your lessees want to be able to update their order not from their office but from their cellar using their smartphone or their tablet device.

### You want an easy way to manage your negotiated or banded price lists and price adjustments

You have negotiated price lists and complex pricing rules: you have a range of price bands, price-effective dates and a whole range of pub- and depot-specific price adjustments too. You need a better way to manage this complexity.

### You need inventory transparency

You want your lessees to know which products are available to order today and which products will be available to order next Tuesday based on depot availability taking into account delivery lead times where appropriate and where a product suddenly becomes unavailable you want to inform your lessees about this in real-time.

### Youâ€™d like to get continuous improvements

We are constantly developing **Pub Buying Club** and our **Cloud Platform** and want to innovate for you.
