## Supercharged Promotions

Promotions supercharged with the power of Customer Cloud.

## Easily create personalised offers

An intuitive UI reduces the complexity of campaign creation. Our easy-to-use, drag ‘n drop interface means no marketer needs to wait for development to implement marketing strategies.

## You want more shipping discount options

Discount by shipping method and create other shipment specific discounts using shipment expressions. Do you have multiple shipments? We let you qualify a discount on a per-shipment basis so you don't lose money.

## You'd like to offer gift and discount choices

Offer your customers a selection of gifts when they qualify. Or offer them a selection of discounted items (% $ or price point). Great for offering a gift that comes in different sizes or colours, tailoring to different groups (like men and women) or offering companion product discounts (like discounted batteries with a toy).

## You want to increase average order value

Tell your customers how many more items to add for a multi-buy, or how much more they need to spend to qualify for a discount. Make it easy for them to complete the deal. We provide quantity and amount distance information to you.

## You'd like per discount price ordering

Sometimes you want to discount the cheapest item, sometimes the most expensive. You no longer have to pick one or the other. Set a default (usually cheapest) and then override the default on a per discount basis.

## You want to tier multiple discounts

Give your customers more when they spend more. Or just make certain discounts mutually exclusive. Easy to configure and works independently of normal interaction settings, so you won’t have to worry about them.

## You'd like to better understand your discounts

Discounts are complicated! Sometimes you just can't figure out why it's not working as you expect. We provide a step-by-step log of the promotion application process, right down to the individual item quantity! Our detailed diagnostics mean you'll never be lost again.
