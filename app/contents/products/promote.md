## Why 

### You want to allow customers to receive discounts on branded products they have chosen themselves

You want to allow your customers to choose a brand or brands from a selection of brands and receive a 10% discount on all products from the selected brands or pick, say, 10 products from the hundreds available and receive a value or percentage discount. 

### You want more shipping discount options

Discount by shipping method and create other shipment specific discounts using shipment expressions. Do you have multiple shipments? We let you qualify a discount on a per-shipment basis so you don't lose money.

### You'd like to offer gift and discount choices

Offer your customers a selection of gifts when they qualify. Or offer them a selection of discounted items (% $ or price point). Great for offering a gift that comes in different sizes or colours, tailoring to different groups (like men and women) or offering companion product discounts (like discounted batteries with a toy).

### You want to increase average order value

Tell your customers how many more items to add for a multi-buy, or how much more they need to spend to qualify for a discount. Make it easy for them to complete the deal. We provide quantity and amount distance information to you.

### You'd like per discount price ordering

Sometimes you want to discount the cheapest item, sometimes the most expensive. You no longer have to pick one or the other. Set a default (usually cheapest) and then override the default on a per discount basis.

### You want to tier multiple discounts

Give your customers more when they spend more. Or just make certain discounts mutually exclusive.

### You'd like to better understand your discounts

Discounts are complicated! Sometimes you just can't figure out why it's not working as you expect. We provide a step-by-step log of the promotion application process, right down to the individual item quantity. Our detailed diagnostics mean you'll never be lost again.
