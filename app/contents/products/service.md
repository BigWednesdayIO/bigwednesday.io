## Empower agents. Wow customers.

Empower agents with a single, unified experience to deliver fast, amazing customer service from a desktop or mobile device. Agents can access every source of information they need, across a diverse environment, to provide more personalised care. They can leverage guided resolution features, such as call scripting and policy adherence, and a process-driven user experience, all from a centralised view.

Service for Commerce Cloud Platform enables agents to manage calls faster and provide differentiated levels of support. With mobile service capabilities, organisations can expand their resource pools and free agents from their desks, helping to increase agent efficiency and reduce cost per call.

Personalised, proactive and predictive experiences across all channels. Agents are empowered with a single unified experience enabling them to connect with customers effortlessly.

Cross-channel service, increased agent productivity and adaptive service models. Decrease cost per call and increase agent satisfaction. Happier agents are twice as likely to deliver critical customer satisfaction metrics.
