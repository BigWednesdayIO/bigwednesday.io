## Introducing Customer Cloud

Out of the box big data architecture, processing and storage. Built for business, loved by IT. Cloud-native APIs, real-time big data processing.

Real-time access to hundreds of data points representing the entirety of a customerâ€™s online and offline purchase and browsing history as well as hundreds more outlet, account, agreement and other data points gives your sales, service and online marketing teams fresh and actionable data to improve customer relationships and build advocacy.

## Inside the Customer Cloud

The Customer Cloud is at the heart of our data supply chain and comprises four parts: processing the data and enriching through categorisation; storage in a large scalable database; aggregation and routing and preparing for data warehouse consumption and then finally providing access in our data warehouse. At each stage the data is accessible via API. The use of API is dependent on the use case with variations ranging from large batch data imports via the Import API to quicker than a blink of an eye lookups.
